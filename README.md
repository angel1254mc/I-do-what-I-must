</div>
Voxel Jump is functionally a recreation of Doodle Jump on HTML Canvas, with support for multiplayer with anywhere from 2 to 20 players in one game! You can sign in with github to have your voxel carry your Github Avatar, and compete against your friends in a race mode where you battle it out to get to the finish line first.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started / Installation

[You can play the prototype right now by clicking here](https://voxel-jump.herokuapp.com/)

Or, you can run your own server for the game on Heroku!
Like usual, clone the repository and install all the dependencies using npm
```
git clone https://github.com/angel1254mc/I-do-what-I-must.git
npm install
```
Then, change the firebaseConfig to your own Authentication and Firestore keys.
To test it locally, you can run use the default NextJS scripts
```
npm run dev
(or)
npm run build
```
If the build works fine, you can go ahead and deploy it on any service that supports it. I've found heroku works great!
